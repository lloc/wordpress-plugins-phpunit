# Unittests for WordPress plugins (without WP)

Repository for my workshop at [WordCamp Catania 2019](https://2019.catania.wordcamp.org/)

_Optional, but you might need to [get docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed:_
                       
    sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

## Step 3

Create a directory that will give a home to a small test-class named _WcctaTest.php_:

    mkdir -p tests/wccta

Excellent! Now let's create a *phpunit.xml* configuration file in the root directory.

> You could also decide to run your tests with the configuration parameters from the command-line. See the next part (hint: 'scripts')!  

Great! Add some sections to the *composer.json* file:

- **name**: that's the project's name for packagist.org
- **description**: that's the description for packagist.org
- **type**: defines the code as WordPress plugin 
- **autoload**: Let's use a PSR-4 autoloader!
- **scripts**: now you can just type `composer test`
