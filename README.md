# Unittests for WordPress plugins (without WP)

Repository for my workshop at [WordCamp Catania 2019](https://2019.catania.wordcamp.org/)

---

Let's install *PHPUnit*:

 `composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit ^8.3`

Please, check also the [requirements](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/8.3/installation.html#requirements)!

> PHPUnit 8.3 requires at least PHP 7.2! By the way - security support for PHP 7.1 ends on 1st of December 2019.
